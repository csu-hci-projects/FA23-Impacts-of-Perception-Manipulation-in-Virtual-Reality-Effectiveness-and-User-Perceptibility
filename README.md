# FA23-Impacts-of-Perception-Manipulation-in-Virtual-Reality-Effectiveness-and-User-Perceptibility

## A Short Description of Our Application

Our application is a simulated target shooting range. Only the right controller is needed, and the top trigger is used to fire a laser at the targets. Once the application is loaded, the user has 10 seconds to shoot the targets. After this time expires, the application closes.
